# Word Frame Music Box

## Description

This project was made as a Christmas gift for Christmas 2020.
The goal was to create a picture frame box that would play the song "Paper Rings" by Taylor Swift
and light up the lyrics as they were sung. 
This was accomplished using an Arduino Mega microcontroller to both play the music and control the LEDs.
The main notable concession that was made was in the audio. 
The song had to be played as beep tones as the arduino was not able to properly play audio files.
